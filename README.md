# Arunabh Bhattacharyya - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built from the ground up with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It's designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience in a clean, modern, and interactive way.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches my latest projects and profile information directly from the GitHub API.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes engaging 3D hover effects, a typing animation, and a friendly pixel bot mascot that jumps on click.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
- **Tech Stack Showcase**: A dynamic, scrolling marquee of the technologies I work with, complete with colored logos.
